The Graphical Thread Profiler is a simple tool to allow easy visualisation of threads, processes or any paralell python code.

1. Run the example code thread_demo.py
2. Run the GraphicalThreadProcessor with the log file as an output.
3. Look at the resulting html file.

Make your logging configuration compatable with the one in thread_demo to see any code.
